# Overview 
The purpose of this program is for the user to have a simple way to prioritize items (tasks) in a To-Do list. Each item has a description, date, status, and priority. The user has the option to add, remove, or edit items. When the user wants to save or load a To-Do list, they have the option to do so as well, or the list will be saved automatically when exiting the application.

# Getting Started
To begin using the To-Do list, a To-Do list text file may be loaded into the application or new To-Do list items can be added to the empty list.

To *add* a new item to the list, simply click ‘Add’. This will prompt the user with the Add New Task Dialogue Box. In this dialogue box, the user will be asked to enter a description, date, status, and priority of the new task. Once the fields have been filled out, simply click ‘Okay’ to submit the item into the To-Do list.

To *remove* an item in the To-Do list, simply click the item to select it, then click ‘Remove’. This will remove the item from the list and automatically update the priority list if necessary.

To *edit* an item from the To-Do list, simply click the item to select it, then click ‘Edit’. This will prompt the user with the Edit Task Dialogue Box. In this dialogue box the fields of the item will be pre-filled with the current information of the task. To edit a field, simply select it and modify the data. Next, click ‘Okay’ to submit the changes to the To-Do list.

To *save* a list, simply click ‘Save’. This will create or overwrite the file ‘To-Do List.txt’ with the To-Do list information.

To *load* a list, simply click ‘Load’. This will search for the file ‘To-Do List.txt’. The file must be in the same directory as the To-Do list application. If the file can be found it will be loaded into the list, otherwise an error will be shown.

To *reset* the list, simply click ‘Reset’. This will clear the contents of the list.

To *sort* the list, simply click on the label of any column header. Clicking once will color the label background blue, denoting ascending order. Clicking twice will color the label background red, denoting descending order.

To *view a report* of the list, simply click ‘Report’. This will prompt the user with the Report List Dialogue Box. In this dialogue box, the user will be shown a read-only version of the To-Do list. Here the user may copy the report to the system clipboard, or print a physical copy of the report.
